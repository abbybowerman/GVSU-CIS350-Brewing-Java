# Overview

The purpose of this updated SRS is to layout the additional functional and non-functional requirments that we have added to complete our app. This document will describe functions that the app already contains and that are in the progress of being finished to ensure an optimal interaction with the app for users. Additionally, this document will explain our approach and use of various testing methods within the project.
