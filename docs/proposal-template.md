# Introduction

Our team plans on creating a android mobile app that allows users choose a category such as restuarants, tv shows/ movies, games andhelps them come to a conclusion on what to eat, watch or do. The app would allow users to make decisions on what to do with friends easier. The app would help narrow down choices so a user or group of users wouldn't feel overwhelmed by their options.

The home screen of the app would allow the user to choose a category that would act as their status on what they wanted to do. The app would include a list of your friends and which category they are hoping to make a decision in. The app would offer a swiping menu to allow choices to be narrowed down.    

# Anticipated Technologies

*A registration system
*Android Studio

# Method/Approach

Our team plans to work on the project in an agile/scrum sort of way, but instead of just weekly
assignments we plan to assign large chunks of the project to each member and then have
weekly checkpoints that need to be hit. We felt this will prevent it from being overwhelming and
we will stay on track because each member will have a precise check point that needs to be hit
by the next weekly meeting.

# Estimated Timeline

We hope to have a home screen and registration system in place by October 16th. We then hope to have a swiping system and other features done by November 6th. We then hope to maintain and fix bugs from then until presentation time.

# Anticipated Problems

The registration system might be difficult to set up how we want to. Learning Android Studio might also be a bit of a learning curve as we build the app. We also don't know how to implement an API which may cause issues.
